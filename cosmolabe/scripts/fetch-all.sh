# Fetch every kernel a fresh clone needs to run the bundled demos.
#
# Why: large SPICE kernels (de440s.bsp, mar099s.bsp, ref_trj_scpse.bsp, etc.)
# live behind fetch scripts instead of in git so the repo stays thin. CI
# should run this before `vite build` for the deployed viewer.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/fetch-all.sh
