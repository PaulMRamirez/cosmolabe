 * Test-harness kernel loading. Generalizes the proven `readKernel` helper from

 * gzipped to keep the checkout small).
 *
 * NOTE: this file lives under `__tests__/_harness/` (not a `*.test.ts` file) so
 * vitest's `include` glob won't try to run it as a suite, and the package tsc
 * build (which excludes `src/__tests__`) won't compile it.
